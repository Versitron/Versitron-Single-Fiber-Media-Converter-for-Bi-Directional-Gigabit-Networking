# Versitron | Single Fiber Media Converter for Bi-Directional Ethernet Networks

Versitron’s single fiber media converters are designed to support bi-directional Ethernet communication over a single strand of fiber. By using separate transmit and receive wavelengths on the same fiber core, these converters reduce fiber usage while supporting long-distance and extended-range deployments. This solution is ideal for enterprise, industrial, and campus networks where fiber availability is limited or cost optimization is required.

## What is a Single Fiber Media Converter?

A single fiber media converter enables full-duplex Ethernet transmission over one optical fiber strand. Instead of using two fibers for separate transmit and receive paths, it combines TX and RX traffic through wavelength-based separation. This design supports efficient network expansion while maintaining reliable data performance.
